# What is this project?
This project is a low-key string fuctions to show how we can work on strings on C.

What we have in this project is 2 .c files -> Main, stringFunc.

Main - recieves a "word" that he has to preform actions with and recives a "text" that we search the "word" inv

after runing in Linux enviorment you need to write "make all" command to compile it all and ./stringProg to active it.

stringFunc - has 3 main functions:

gemetria - searches in the "text" for strings with the same gematric value as the "word"

abtash - searches for abtasah sequences of the "word" in the "text"

anagram - searches for sub-suequences that contain the "word" in the "text" (DOES NOT INCLUDE MEANINGLESS KEYS SUCH AS 0-9,#!@ etc..)

# How to activate

Please open a Linux enviroment (or use bash on cmd) and type "make all", after that all the files will apear and you will have to open the ./exe file

Hope you enjoy my writings and find good usage to them :)
